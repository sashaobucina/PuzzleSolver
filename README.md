# PuzzleSolver

Implementation of generic puzzle solver that solves various puzzle games using breadth-first and depth-first traversal of the puzzle's decision tree.

This project plays around with class inheritance and generic defintions in the form of an abstract Puzzle Solver class. Additionally,
time complexity of the two basic tree traversal algorithms is analyzed to determine which problem types illicit which tree
traversal algorithm that results in a better runtime.
